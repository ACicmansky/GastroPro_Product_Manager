# Scraping Enhancements and Empty Catalog Number Filtering

## Date: July 16, 2025

## Summary
Today we implemented critical fixes and enhancements to the GastroPro Product Manager application, primarily focused on two areas:

1. Implementing proper filtering of products with empty catalog numbers across all data sources
2. Documenting the comprehensive scraping architecture and data flow

## Empty Catalog Number Filtering

### Problem
Products with empty "Kat. číslo" (catalog number) values were being included in the merged CSV output, causing issues with data integrity and downstream processing.

### Solution
Implemented a cleaning step in the Worker.run method that filters out any products with empty catalog numbers before the merge process:

- Added filtering for the main CSV data
- Added filtering for all XML feed data
- Added filtering for Topchladenie.sk data (both scraped and loaded from CSV)
- Provided detailed logging of removed product counts for user transparency

### Implementation Details
```python
# Clean the main dataframe - filter out rows with empty catalog numbers
join_column = "Kat. číslo"
if join_column in filtered_df.columns:
    # Count products before filtering
    before_count = len(filtered_df)
    # Remove empty catalog numbers (empty strings, NaN or None)
    filtered_df = filtered_df[filtered_df[join_column].notna() & (filtered_df[join_column].str.strip() != "")]
    removed_count = before_count - len(filtered_df)
    if removed_count > 0:
        self.progress.emit(f"Removed {removed_count} products with empty catalog numbers from main CSV")
```

The same pattern is applied to all other data sources consistently before merging.

## Scraping Architecture Documentation

We've documented the complete scraping architecture in the memory-bank, including:

1. **Technology Stack**:
   - Added BeautifulSoup4 as a key dependency for HTML parsing
   - Added concurrent.futures for multi-threading capabilities
   - Added tqdm as an optional dependency for progress reporting

2. **Scraping Components**:
   - Base scraper class: `TopchladenieScraper`
   - Enhanced multi-threaded scraper: `FastTopchladenieScraper`
   - Integration points with Worker class

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Detailed the 8-step process from initialization to integration
   - Documented mutual exclusivity between scraping and CSV loading
   - Added data cleaning step specifically for empty catalog numbers

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: 
   - Ensures all products in the merged output have valid catalog numbers
   - Prevents downstream issues with invalid product identification

2. **User Experience**:
   - Provides transparent feedback about removed products
   - Maintains consistent data quality across all operations

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Consistent handling of empty values across all data sources
   - Clear architecture documentation for future maintenance

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding additional validation for other required fields
2. Implement memory optimization for very large datasets
3. Add user confirmation when replacing existing data in export file
