# AI Enhancement Implementation - 2025-08-05

## Overview
Implemented AI-powered product description enhancement using Google's Gemini API with parallel processing and quota management.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Core Functionality
- Integrated Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model for text generation
- Batch processing of product descriptions with configurable batch sizes
- Parallel execution with ThreadPoolExecutor for improved performance
- Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanism

### 2. Quota Management
- Enforced API rate limits (15 calls/minute)
- Token usage tracking (250,000 tokens/minute)
- Automatic waiting and retry when limits are reached
- Thread-safe counters for accurate quota tracking

### 3. Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress updates through callback system
- Incremental saving of processed data to temporary files
- Status tracking with timestamps (Spracovane AI, AI_Processed_Date)
- Detailed logging for monitoring and debugging

### 4. Configuration
- Added AI-specific settings to config.json:
  - Model selection (gemini-2.5-flash-lite)
  - Batch size (45)
  - Temperature (0.1 for consistent outputs)
  - Max parallel calls (5)
  - Retry attempts and delays

## Technical Implementation

### Code Structure
- Created `AIEnhancementProcessor` class to handle all AI-related operations
- Implemented thread-safe quota management using `threading.Lock`
- Added support for both cp1250 and UTF-8 encodings with automatic fallback
- Integrated with existing progress reporting system

### Key Methods
- `process_dataframe`: Main entry point for processing product data
- `process_batch_with_retry`: Handles batch processing with retry logic
- `_check_and_wait_for_quota`: Manages API rate limits
- `_process_single_batch`: Processes individual batches in parallel
- `update_dataframe`: Updates the main dataframe with enhanced descriptions

## Testing & Validation
- Verified correct processing of special characters and encodings
- Tested with various batch sizes and parallelization levels
- Validated quota management under high load
- Confirmed proper error handling and recovery

## Dependencies Added
- google-generativeai>=0.5.0
- python-dotenv>=1.0.0

## Configuration Updates
```json
"ai_enhancement": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
    "batch_size": 45,
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "retry_attempts": 3,
    "retry_delay": 60,
    "max_parallel_calls": 5
}
```

## Next Steps
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Fine-tune prompts for better quality outputs
- Add more detailed progress reporting
- Consider implementing a preview feature for AI-generated content
