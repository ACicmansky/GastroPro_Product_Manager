# Journal Entry: Initial Setup (2025-07-02)

## Summary of Work
Today marks the beginning of the GastroPro Product Manager project. I've analyzed the existing codebase and created the memory bank structure to track project progress and maintain context.

## Codebase Analysis
The existing codebase consists of:

1. **app.py**: Contains the main PyQt5 application with basic UI and functionality:
   - Window setup with basic controls (buttons, labels)
   - CSV loading functionality
   - Placeholder for data processing
   - CSV saving functionality
   
2. **utils.py**: Contains utility functions:
   - Configuration management (load/save)
   - XML feed parsing placeholder
   - Default configuration creation

3. **config.json**: Contains application configuration:
   - App settings (title, version)
   - Data source settings (CSV configuration, XML feed URLs)
   - Output settings

## Current Implementation Status
- The application has a basic UI framework in place
- CSV loading and saving functionality is implemented
- Configuration management is working
- XML feed parsing has a placeholder but is not fully implemented
- No category filtering is implemented yet
- Data processing is a placeholder that simply copies input to output

## Next Implementation Steps
1. Implement category selection from CSV data using the "Hlavna kateg√≥ria" field
2. Complete XML feed parsing with proper data extraction
3. Create merging logic between CSV and XML data
4. Enhance the UI for a better user experience
5. Add data validation and error handling

## Technical Decisions
- Using PyQt5 for UI provides a solid foundation for a desktop application
- Pandas is an excellent choice for CSV data manipulation
- The configuration file structure is well-designed for flexibility
- The current architecture follows good separation of concerns

## Challenges Identified
- Need more specific information about XML feed structure for complete parsing
- Category selection UI needs to be designed and implemented
- Data merging logic needs to be defined in more detail
